You can create a NetApp Support Site user ID through the NetApp Console web UI. This ID is included when creating system using the Console.

.About this task

Registering support site credentials with the Console and creating an NSS ID enables several features, including subscription to the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, upgrade of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP software to the latest release, and predictive analytics. For information about related NSS administrative tasks, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_adding_nss_accounts.html[Manage NSS credentials^].

.Before you begin

You must have an account for the Console. You normally create this account when first signing in to the Console website and it's displayed at the top of the web user interface. 

.Steps

. Navigate to the Console website using a browser:
+
https://console.bluexp.netapp.com

. Sign in using your account credentials for the Console.

. Select the *?* icon at the top right of the page and select *Support*.

. Navigate to the *NSS Management* tab and click *Add NSS Account*.

. When prompted, click *Continue* which redirects you to a Microsoft login page.
+
NetApp uses Microsoft Azure Active Directory as the identity provider for authentication services specific to support and licensing.

. Provide the NSS email address and password. After successful authentication, you will be redirected to the Console page and an NSS user ID will be automatically generated.

.After you finish

You can use the generated NSS user ID when creating a system with your preferred licensing model and cloud provider. The NSS user ID is *required* with BYOL licensing and *optional* for the PAYGO subscription.
