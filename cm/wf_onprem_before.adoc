There are several workflows you can use to manage the ONTAP on-premises clusters.

[NOTE]
Review the link:overview.html[Get started] section before using the on-premises ONTAP workflows.

== Workflow categories

The ONTAP on-premises workflows are organized into the following functional categories:

* systems
* Aggregates
* Volumes

See the link:workflow_processes.html[Workflow processes] for more information on these categories.

== Console agent setup

You can discover and manage on-premises ONTAP clusters with or without a Console agent. If you choose to use a Console agent, you need to install and deploy the Console agent in your cloud provider or on-premises environment. A direct discovery of the on-premises ONTAP clusters is also available through the NetApp Console; you don't require a Console agent for this option. Using a Console agent provides you with additional features and is required to manage volumes using the API. See link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-ontap-onprem/task-discovering-ontap.html[Discover on-premises ONTAP clusters^] to learn more about the available options to manage on-premises ONTAP clusters.
